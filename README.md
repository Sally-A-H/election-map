# election-map
This was a challenge for me, which I found surprising as I thought I had kind of aced the javaScript unit 😕 . However, as always with 
Skillcrush projects, great learning was accomplished and errors that stumped me were again simply solved! One (getting the "Draw" to work in 
the interactive table) was a typo. And the second one that took me ages to figure out (the colors were reversed on map/state mouse over)
I had inadvertantly flipped the rgb color values for the politicians. Kind of a logical solution now that I think of it but hey ho ...
perseverence prevailed and it is complete (Woop!Woop!). I am a happy coder again 😃! Oh and hey, I still have hair left 👍 !!!
